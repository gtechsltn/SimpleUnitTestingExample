# .NET provides several robust frameworks for unit testing:

* xUnit
* NUnit
* MSTest
* TUnit

# Design Patterns
* AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)

You may also notice the comments in the test. This follows the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern, which is a widely used convention for structuring unit tests:

* Arrange: Set up the necessary objects and state. In this case, we create a new product, which is unpublished by default.
* Act: Perform the action being tested. Here, we call Publish() on the product.
* Assert: Verify the expected outcome. We check if the productâ€™s status is now Published.
* This structure makes tests easier to read and understand while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

## Handling Exceptions

```
// Act
var exception = Assert.Throws<InvalidOperationException>(() => product.Publish());
```

# Libraries
* Moq
* NSubstitute
* Bogus
* FluentAssertions
